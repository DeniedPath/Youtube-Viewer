# YouTube Focus Viewer

## Overview
YouTube Focus Viewer is a web application designed to enhance focus time when watching YouTube videos by removing distractions and providing a cleaner viewing experience.

## Features
- Embed YouTube videos without navigating to YouTube.com
- Distraction-free viewing interface  
- CSS grid layout for improved user experience
- Main video section with a placeholder for 4-5 related videos
- Theme customization with user preference tracking

## Problem Statements and Solutions

### Initial Problem
Users wanted a way to watch YouTube videos with reduced distractions.

**Solution:** Created an HTML webpage that embeds a YouTube Video viewer using HTML5 elements for videos and links.

### User Experience Improvement  
The initial layout provided limitations and a suboptimal user experience.

**Solution:** Implemented a CSS grid layout with a main video section and a placeholder for related videos, improving overall usability and increasing site traffic.

### Theme Customization Tracking
Uncertainty about the usage and value of a theme customization feature.

**Solution:** Implemented a theme customization option with user data collection (email and name) to track usage. User preferences are stored locally and restored upon application reload.

## Technical Implementation
- HTML5 video elements
- CSS grid for layout
- Local Storage for saving user preferences
- Form popup for collecting user data when changing themes  
- Event handling for theme selection

## Usage
1. Open the web application
2. Select a video to watch in the main viewing area
3. Browse related videos in the placeholder section below
4. To change the theme, click the theme button and fill out the form
5. Your theme preference will be saved and applied on future visits

## Future Enhancements
- Analytics integration for better understanding of feature usage
- Expanded theme options
- User accounts for cross-device preference syncing
